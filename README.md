# Examination-Timetabling-Problem
This project presents a heuristic to solve a simplified examination timetabling problem.


### Run the .jar file
In order to run the program the input files (`.exm`, `.slo`, `.stu`) for every instance _**must be**_ in the same folder of the `.jar` file.

      $ java -jar ETPsolver.jar instancename -t tlim

You can find the output file (`instanceXX.sol`) again in the same folder of the `.jar` file. The file .sol will be overwritten
every time a better solution is found.
